        <h3 class="sub-title">what makes a good leader?</h3>
        <p>
          This is the question SLF attempts to answer at our annual SOAR event.
          SOAR encourages people of all ages and backgrounds to become leaders
          in their local communities. We equip attendees with the problem
          solving skills and key strategies they need to be great leaders.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is no pervasive agreement as to what skills and attributes make
          an effective leader. Ideally, a leader always strives to maintain a
          balance between meeting the needs of the organization and those of the
          followers. Leadership is a complex process that combines ethics and
          relationships with decisive action. Depending on the environment, a
          leader may use any combination of styles to achieve success.
        </p>
        <p>
          Different leadership approaches are needed in various settings and
          cultures. Each individual in an organization is a leader in their own
          right. Everyone contributes something meaningful to an organization.
          Without follower's continued participation in the leadership process,
          the entire system falls apart. There are multiple approaches and
          facets to leadership that vary significantly upon many different
          factors.
